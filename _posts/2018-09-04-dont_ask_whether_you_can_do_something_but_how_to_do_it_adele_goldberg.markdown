Many things in life seem impossible but we have to look for solutions and understand that failure will be part of that process.   Be willing to see the differences between what a customer and developer see as requirements and motivators. As a system engineer deploying software, I was always puzzled by the 20-80 rule-that 80% of the population would only use 20% of a software's features…why don’t we develop software that is easily adaptable to 80% of the population???? It is what made Apple a very successful company.

Adele Goldberg was a computer science pioneer woman who along with Alan Kay, developed Smalltalk at Xerox PARC. Smalltalk was used to prototype the WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointers) as we see in today’s modern graphical user interfaces. They led the way in making systems easy to use. Their great ideas were on the leading edge, but they had a difficult time at selling those ideas to upper management because of their uniqueness. I love her quote "nothing motivates a research team more than to be told you can't do it".  All coaches should say that to their 12-year old robotics kids…you see amazing things emerge!

Adele worked with others in seeing hardware as an object and the software also as an object with the combined product being the "package". This modularity we take for granted as software developers, but it plays a vital role is what we develop. In a short period of time, computer languages and software have gone from being hardware-specific to running on numerous operating systems running on multiple hardware platforms with multiple connectivity platforms. Wow!

Adele also saw value in teaching computer science to others and collaboration. Whether you are age 6 or 60, your learning process should be on a continuum.   At age 6, you are a sponge and you absorb everything that comes your way.  At age 50, you may learn at a slower pace and by a different means, but you bring value to the overall picture.  Make learning a lifetime activity at all ages. Next week, I get to teach robotics and coding to a group of older people through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute-I am a little nervous, but I hope I can share some of what I have learned. Share your knowledge and passions!
