With a degree in computer science and EET, I have spent the last 24 years working for the same bank in positions from management to research and design to system engineer. I have been working a very flexible job-share work schedule that has allowed me to raise our family while pursuing volunteer endeavors including forming a very competitive youth robotics club in our community.  The bank decided to end the job-share position, so it was the ideal time to make a career change and pursue web development. The Web is such an integral part of our lives and I have some great ideas of products I would like to develop.  I am currently in the Flatiron Full Stack Web Development online program and I look forward to learning new things while bringing my ideas to life!
